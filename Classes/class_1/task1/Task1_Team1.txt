Eduardo
Blaze of Glory
I wake up in the morning
And I raise my weary head
I got an old coat for a pillow
And the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm goin'
Only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run
A six gun lover
A candle in the wind, yeah
You're brought into this world
But they say you're born in sin
Well at least they've given me something
I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well, they tell me that I'm wanted
Yeah I'm a wanted man
I'm colt in your stable
I'm what Cain was to Able
Mister catch me if you can
I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm no one's son
Call me young gun
You ask about my conscience
And I offer you my soul
You ask if I'll grow to be a wise man
Well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I known love
And what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come
I've seen it shot down
I've seen it die in vain
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
But I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm a devil's son
Call me young gun
Each night I go to bed
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No, I ain't lookin' for forgiveness
But before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I got to ask a favor
And I'll hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest
Let this boy die like a man
Starin' down the bullet
Let me make my final stand
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first
But, I drew first blood
I'm no one's son
Call me young gun
I'm the young gun
Young gun, yea eee yea
Young gun
MIGUEL
The king and his men
Stole the queen from her bed
And bound her in her bones
The seas be ours
And by the powers
Where we will, we'll roam

Yoho, all together
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die!

Yoho, haul together
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die!

Some men have died
And some are alive
And others sail on the sea
With the keys to the cage
And the devil to pay
We lay to Fiddler's Green

Yoho, all together
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die!

The bell has been raised
From it's watery grave
Do you hear it's sepulchral tone?
We are a call to all
Pay head the squall
And turn your sail toward home

Yoho, all together
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die!

Yoho, all together
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die!
